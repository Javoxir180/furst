                <h2>Interior Design Ideas for Your Modern Home</h2>
                <p>The place where we all gather, laugh and play is undoubtedly the living room. The focal point of a
                    home, its place between kitchen and bedroom acts as a natural centre, drawing guests from morning
                    wake-ups to after-work nights in. These fifty modern living rooms show stretch in a variety of
                    substrates and styles. Centre modern furniture around a cubic rug.</p>
